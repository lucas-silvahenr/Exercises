## Problem Summary

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each node contains a single digit.

Add the two numbers and return the result as a linked list in the same reversed format. You may assume that the two numbers do not contain leading zeros, except for the number `0` itself.

## Examples

### Example 1

```text
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.
```

### Example 2

```text
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

### Example 3

```text
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```

## Constraints

```text
The number of nodes in each linked list is in the range [1, 100].
0 <= Node.val <= 9

It is guaranteed that the list represents a number with no leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.
```
